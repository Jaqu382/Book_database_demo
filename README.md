# Book_database_demo

Demo of a book database created for my UCF 3134C class

This is a simple book recording database that is meant to function as a the skeleton for a potential future personal project.

Functionality includes being able to narrow down table size to a specific row, adding entries to the table, removing entries to the table, and removing existing entries.

A potential future improvement could be allowing the user to search the database by genre, tags, or authors. Perhaps including a way to associate multiple tags with a book.
